# Web Shop Front End

This directory would contain the source code for a **Single Page Application (SPA)** frontend for the web shop. 

## Overview

The frontend application interacts with the `broker/` service's REST API to display products, handle user input, manage the shopping cart, and initiate orders. It provides a dynamic and responsive user experience by handling UI logic on the client-side.

## Key Responsibilities

* **User Interface:** Renders the web shop's graphical user interface.
* **API Communication:** Makes asynchronous requests to the Broker's REST API to fetch data and submit orders.
* **Client-Side Logic:** Manages user interactions, form validations, and dynamic content updates without full page reloads.
* **Authentication Flow:** Integrates with Auth0 for client-side authentication and token management.
